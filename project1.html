<!--
The code below defines an object prototype called "Truck". Truck needs to have the following features:

Properties:

gas (number type)
mpg (number type)
range (number type)
empty (boolean type)
Methods:

drive(miles) (no return value)
fill(gallons) (no return value)
 

Your job is to supply the missing properties and methods.
Here are some notes to help you out:

range = gas * mpg
fill(gallons) should update both gas and empty
 

Test code is included below the script. After you have finished the object prototype, run the script (including the test code) and verify that the test code runs as expected.
